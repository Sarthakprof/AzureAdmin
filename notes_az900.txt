1. Vertical scaling, also known as "scaling up", is the process of adding resources to increase the power of an existing server. Some examples of vertical scaling are: adding more CPUs, or adding more memory.
2. Horizontal scaling, also known as "scaling out", is the process of adding more servers that function together as one unit. For example, you have more than one server processing incoming requests.
3. If you need to store large amount of data that is not accessed frequently then try using Data Warehouse or Data lake
4. If fthe data is is accessed frequesntly then use Azure SQL or Azure Psotgres or Cosmos DB
5. You can visulize your data in Data Warehouse and Data lake using PowerBI.
6. Azure ScaleSets lets you manage 100s of VMs running the same application with same configs
7. Azure AD Protection let you enable and manage and enforce MFA for Users

Azure Cloud Shell
Azure Cloud Shell is a browser-based command-line experience for managing and developing Azure resources. Think of Cloud Shell as an interactive console that you run in the cloud.

Cloud Shell provides two experiences to choose from, Bash and PowerShell. Both include access to the Azure command-line interface called Azure CLI and to Azure PowerShell.

Azure Regions
    A region is a geographical area on the planet containing at least one,
    but potentially multiple datacenters that are nearby and networked together with a low-latency network

    *There are also some global Azure services that do not require you to select a particular region,
    such as Microsoft Azure Active Directory, Microsoft Azure Traffic Manager, and Azure DNS.

    Example:  West US, Canada Central, West Europe, Australia East, and Japan West

Special Azure regions:
    US DoD Central, US Gov Virginia, US Gov Iowa and more: These are physical and logical network-isolated instances of Azure for US government agencies and partners. These datacenters are operated by screened US persons and include additional compliance certifications.

    China East, China North and more: These regions are available through a unique partnership between Microsoft and 21Vianet, whereby Microsoft does not directly maintain the datacenters.
